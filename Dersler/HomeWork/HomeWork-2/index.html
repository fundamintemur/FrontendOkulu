            <p>Dear <br/>SalesPeople,<p>
            <p>We get it. It's your job, and you need to make a living. But we just can't take it anymore. I'm sorry, but we're never going to buy. Let us set you free, and in the process free up our inboxes. Email used to be a wonderful thing. Just like Meg and Tom, we used to get excited each and every time we heard "You've got mail!" But the joy is gone, and email is now another thing on our to-do list, cluttering up our lives. Let's make communication meaningful and intentional again. We're not trying to stop you â€“ just your emails.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,<br>
            <p>Everyone</p>
